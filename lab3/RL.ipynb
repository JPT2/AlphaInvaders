        "\n",
        "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a subset of machine learning which poses learning problems as interactions between agents and environments. It often assumes agents have no prior knowledge of a world, so they must learn to navigate environments by optimizing a reward function. Within an environment, an agent can take certain actions and receive feedback, in the form of positive or negative rewards, with respect to their decision. As such, an agent's feedback loop is somewhat akin to the idea of \"trial and error\", or the manner in which a child might learn to distinguish between \"good\" and \"bad\" actions.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practical terms, our RL agent will interact with the environment by taking an action at each timestep, receiving a corresponding reward, and updating its state according to what it has \"learned\".  \n",

        "In previous labs, we have explored both supervised (with LSTMs, CNNs) and unsupervised / semi-supervised (with VAEs) learning tasks. Reinforcement learning is fundamentally different, in that we are training a deep learning algorithm to govern the actions of our RL agent, that is trying, within its environment, to find the optimal way to achieve a goal. The goal of training an RL agent is to determine the best next step to take to earn the greatest final payoff or return. In this lab, we focus on building a reinforcement learning algorithm to master two different environments with varying complexity. \n",

To access the Cartpole environment, we can use `env = gym.make(\"CartPole-v0\")`, which we gained access to when we imported the `gym` package.

Much like you might use `numpy.random.seed`, we can call the comparable function in gym, `seed`, with our defined environment to ensure the environment's random variables are initialized the same each time."

        "We're almost ready to begin the learning algorithm for our agent! The next step is to compute the rewards of our agent as it acts in the environment. Since we (and the agent) is uncertain about if and when the game or task will end (i.e., when the pole will fall), it is useful to emphasize getting rewards **now** rather than later in the future -- this is the idea of discounting. This is a similar concept to discounting money in the case of interest. Recall from lecture, we use reward discount to give more preference at getting rewards now rather than later in the future. The idea of discounting rewards is similar to discounting money in the case of interest.\n",
        "\n",
        "To compute the expected cumulative reward, known as the **return**, at a given timestep in a learning episode, we sum the discounted rewards expected at that time step $t$, within a learning episode, and projecting into the future. We define the return (cumulative reward) at a time step $t$, $R_{t}$ as:\n",

Intuitively, you can think of this function as depreciating any rewards received at later time steps, which will force the agent prioritize getting rewards now. Since we can't extend episodes to infinity, in practice the computation will be limited to the number of timesteps in an episode -- after that the reward is assumed to be zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "Take note of the form of this sum -- we'll have to be clever about how we implement this function. Specifically, we'll need to initialize an array of zeros, with length of the number of time steps, and fill it with the real discounted reward values as we loop through the rewards from the episode, which will have been saved in the agents memory. What we ultimately care about is which actions are better relative to other actions taken in that episode -- so, we'll normalize our computed rewards, using the mean and standard deviation of the rewards across the learning episode.\n",
